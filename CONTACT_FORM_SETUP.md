# Contact Form Setup Guide

Your contact form has been updated and is ready to work! You just need to complete one simple step to make it functional.

## Option 1: Formspree (Recommended - Free & Easy)

1. **Go to [Formspree.io](https://formspree.io/)**
2. **Sign up for a free account**
3. **Create a new form** and set the email to: `asadulislam0288@gmail.com`
4. **Copy your form endpoint** (it will look like: `https://formspree.io/f/xpznvqrw`)
5. **Update the ContactSection.jsx file:**
   - Find line with: `https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID`
   - Replace `YOUR_FORM_ID` with your actual form ID

## Option 2: Web3Forms (Alternative)

1. **Go to [Web3Forms.com](https://web3forms.com/)**
2. **Get your free access key**
3. **Update the form to use Web3Forms** (I can help you with this if needed)
